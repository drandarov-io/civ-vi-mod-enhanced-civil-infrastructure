Improves several Civil Infrastructure gameplay elements incl. Roads, Canals, Mountain Tunnels, Military Engineers (and Bridges if installed).

Since it changes parts of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2331527458]"Port Lime - Bridge District"[/url], that mod is highly recommended, however it is not required.
