Improves several Civil Infrastructure gameplay elements incl. Roads, Canals, Mountain Tunnels, Military Engineers (and Bridges if installed).

Since it changes parts of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2331527458]"Port Lime - Bridge District"[/url], that mod is highly recommended, however it is not required.

[h2]Some design ideas behind this mod:[h2]
[quote]
[list]
[*] Improve unit mobility with roads
[*] Improve strategic naval mobility with more canals
[*] Increase the maintanance of Civil Infrastructure and add domestic trade route yields to convert gold into food, production and culture
[*] You can now build cities focused on providing food or production to your other cities through trade routes
[*] Make Military Engineer more useful by making things they improve more useful ("Enhanced Military Infrastructure" may come at some point)
