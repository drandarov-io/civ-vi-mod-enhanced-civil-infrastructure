Improves several Civil Infrastructure gameplay elements incl. Roads, Canals, Mountain Tunnels, Military Engineers (and Bridges).

Since it changes parts of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2331527458] "Port Lime - Bridge District" [/url], that mod is required. I haven't managed to make it modular. Help is appreciated.

Full list of changes below (if you have balance suggestions, please post them in the comments):

[h1]Roads[/h1]
[list]
[*] Ancient Roads have Movement Cost of 0.65 (was 1)
[*] Medieval Roads have Movement Cost of 0.5 (was 1)
[*] Industrial Roads have Movement Cost of 0.35 (was 0.75)
[*] Modern Roads have Movement Cost of 0.25 (was 0.5)
[*] Railroads have Movement Cost of 0.125 (was 0.25)
[*] Ancient Roads have bridges over rivers
[/list]

[h1]Canals[/h1]
[list]
[*] Buildable at Engineering Tech (was Steam Power)
[*] Buildable on hills (applied same workaround as other "Canal on Hills" mods since this seems to be somewhat hardcoded)
[*] Provide major adjecency (+2) to Commercial Hubs and Harbors
[*] Provides 1 Housing, because improved infrastructure results in better transport of goods and better mobility e.g. in the outskirts
[*] Provides 2 Food as destination for domestic trade routes

[*] Base cost is 55 (was 81)
[/list]

[*] Provides 2 Culture as destination for domestic trade routes
[*] Base cost is 60 (was 81)
[/list]

[h1]Mountain Tunnels[/h1]
[list]

[/list]

[h1]Military Engineers[/h1]
[list]
[*] Get 3 Movement (was 2)
[*] Get 3 Build Charges (was 2)
[/list]

[h1]Recommended Mods[/h1]

Shouldn't require a new game.
Usage of the Bridge Icon by Lime in the mod thumbnail was approved.
